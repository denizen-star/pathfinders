## 📝 Asset Guidelines

### File Naming Convention
Use descriptive, kebab-case names:
- `onboarding-step-1-mobile.png`
- `architecture-diagram-v4.svg`
- `color-palette-primary.png`
- `user-journey-flow.pdf`

### File Organization
Group related assets in subdirectories:
```
assets/
├── diagrams/
├── screenshots/
├── design/
└── marketing/
```

### File Formats

**Images**: PNG for screenshots, SVG for diagrams  
**Documents**: PDF for presentations, MD for text  
**Videos**: MP4 for demos, GIF for animations

### Best Practices
1. Keep file sizes optimized (< 1MB preferred)
2. Use descriptive names, not DSC_1234.jpg
3. Include creation date in metadata
4. Document source files separately
5. Update documentation when adding assets

# From project root
open docs/assets/Design_Samples/Sample1_Landing.html
```

### Design Evolution

### Current Production
The current production design incorporates elements from all three samples:
- Color scheme inspired by Sample 1 (cyan/blue gradient)
- Messaging philosophy from Sample 2 (anti-random networking)
- Value proposition from Sample 3 (quality connections)
