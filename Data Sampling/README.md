# Pathfinders Data Sampling

This folder contains sample CSV files and the generator script used to create realistic test data for the Pathfinders networking form.

## üìÅ Contents

### CSV Files (Sample Data)
- **pathfinders_step1_submissions.csv** (1000 submissions)
  - Location information with Canadian postal codes (FSA)
  - Device information as JSON string
  
- **pathfinders_step2_submissions.csv** (900 submissions)
  - Contact information (name, email)
  - 90% of Step 1 users who continued
  - Includes Action column (Continue/Skip)
  
- **pathfinders_step3_submissions.csv** (725 submissions)
  - Complete professional profiles with all 15 questions
  - 80.6% of Step 2 users who completed the form
  - Overall completion rate: 72.5% (Step 1 ‚Üí Step 3)

### Generator Script
- **generate_sample_data.py**
  - Python script that generates all three CSV files
  - Requires: `faker` library (`pip3 install faker`)
  
## üéØ Features

### 1. Production-Ready Column Order
All CSV files match the exact column order used in Google Sheets production:

**Step 1:** `Timestamp, Session ID, Postal Code, Device Info`

**Step 2:** `Timestamp, Session ID, Postal Code, Name, Email, Device Info, Action`

**Step 3:** `Timestamp, Session ID, Postal Code, Name, Email, Industry, Education Level, Job Function Level, Company Size, Primary Goal, Connection Types, Work Environment, Collaboration Preferences, Networking Window, Day of Week, Experience, Communication, Interests, Challenges, Additional Info, Device Info, Action`

### 2. Device Info as JSON
Device information is stored as a single JSON string column containing:
```json
{
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "platform": "MacIntel",
  "language": "en-US",
  "screenResolution": "1920x1080",
  "timezone": "America/Toronto",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-06T14:17:45.060Z"
}
```

### 3. Consistent Session Tracking
- Every user journey maintains the same Session ID across all steps
- All Step 2 sessions exist in Step 1
- All Step 3 sessions exist in both Step 2 and Step 1
- Enables complete user journey analysis and funnel tracking

## üöÄ Usage

### Regenerate Sample Data

```bash
cd "Data Sampling"
python3 generate_sample_data.py
```

This will create/overwrite the three CSV files with new randomized data.

### Requirements

```bash
pip3 install faker
```

## üìä Data Characteristics

### Geographic Distribution

## üìà Completion Funnel

```
Step 1 (Location)     1000 users (100%)
       ‚Üì
Step 2 (Contact)       900 users ( 90%)
       ‚Üì
Step 3 (Profile)       725 users ( 81% of Step 2, 73% overall)
```

## üîç Use Cases

- **Testing data visualization dashboards**
- **Load testing import/export functionality**
- **Analyzing user behavior patterns**
- **Training matching algorithms**
